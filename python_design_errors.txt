* Strings should
    * Inherit from Sized, Container[str] instead of Sequence[str], and
    * Expose chars(self) -> Sequence[str].
    * See: https://discuss.python.org/t/an-interesting-pytype-experiment-and-a-possible-extension-to-strings/23749/1

* There should be no __lt__, etc. methods.  Instead, these should be global functions with multiple
  dispatch.  Classes can register their dispatches.
    * See: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-HQa5GOmV-uhTbv6EgnMfJYVgwuYMIrQ

* Dataclasses should have been declared using a base class rather than a decorator.
    * This would fix incompatibility with multiple inheritance and dataclasses.

* The sequence protocol should be removed.
    * See: https://discuss.python.org/t/deprecate-old-style-iteration-protocol/17863

* The export mechanism should be simpler.  Perhaps, an export command that populates __all__ and
  imports symbols.
